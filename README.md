## üíª About:

 api with fastify, prisma, typescript and more.

 Functional Requirements: The user must be able to create a trip; The user should be able to get a summary of the trip;  The user must be able to invite people to the trip via email; the user must be able to create important links for the trip and must be able to create tasks for the trip.

 Notes: this api was created in the rocketseat event (NLW Journey), which lasts three days and each class is about 1 hour, so I didn't have time to make an api with a designem,
 that it is easy to maintain, and that it has a very readable code, but all routes work.
